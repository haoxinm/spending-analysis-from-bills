"""Tests for the built-in rules corpus (D8, P4-B): `classify/builtin_rules.yaml`.

`rules.load_builtin_rules()` already validates every entry against the taxonomy and
self-tests each rule against its own `test_description` at import time (`classify/rules.py`);
this file adds the corpus-quality checks that are P4-B's own job: the corpus is close to the
~120-pattern target, every rule's own example matches (re-asserted explicitly here, not just
relied on at import), a set of near-miss merchants that share a substring with some pattern but
are a *different* real merchant do **not** match any rule (precision over recall), and no two
rules that disagree on category/subcategory both match the same merchant_key (an ambiguous rule
pair would make the cascade's builtin-rule step non-deterministic in effect, since only the
first hit in list order would apply, silently discarding another rule's claim).
