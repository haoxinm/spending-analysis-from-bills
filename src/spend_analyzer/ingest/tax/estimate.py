"""Preferential-vs-ordinary federal income tax estimate (plan 2.6).

Splits Form 1040 line 16 (income tax) into the part attributable to ordinary income and the part
attributable to qualified dividends plus net long-term capital gain, by re-running the IRS
"Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet" with bracket data from
``data/federal_brackets.yaml`` (tax years 2022-2025; real IRS figures, see that file's header).

Units: every amount is an integer number of minor units (cents). Tax results are whole dollars
(multiples of 100) like the printed form. For taxable income under $100,000 the IRS Tax Table
(tax computed at the midpoint of each $25/$50 row) is reproduced; at or above $100,000 the Tax
Computation Worksheet (exact bracket arithmetic) is used. Income is floored to whole dollars.

Out of scope (the result is flagged ``approximate`` by callers when the printed tax disagrees):
Schedule D Tax Worksheet (28% collectibles gain, unrecaptured section 1250 gain), Form 4952
investment-interest election, Form 8814/4972 tax, foreign earned income exclusion.
