"""PDF text-layer extraction and text-layer detection (P1-A, §3.1, §3.12a).

`extract()` is the single place a PDF's bytes are turned into an `ExtractedDoc`: plain text per
page plus word bounding boxes, read once with `pdfplumber` (built on `pdfminer.six`). Everything
downstream — issuer detection, parser scoring, and every `StatementParser.parse()` — consumes an
`ExtractedDoc`, never the PDF file itself.

Text-layer detection (whether the PDF is a scanned/image-only document) is a *report*, not a
raise: a caller decides what to do with `has_text_layer=False` (P2-A maps it to
``status='no_text_layer'``). The one condition this module does raise for is a PDF it cannot open
at all: a password-protected file.

No network, ever (I3): this module opens no socket and imports no HTTP client.

    Opens the PDF exactly once with `pdfplumber` and reads every page's `extract_text()` and
    `extract_words()` while the file is open, so a large statement is never re-opened per page.
    Word coordinates (`Word.x0`/`x1`/`top`/`bottom`) are kept because statement tables are
    visually aligned: column x-ranges are the most reliable signal `ingest/layout.py` has for
    locating a table and its columns.

    Sets `ExtractedDoc.has_text_layer` to `False` when the *median* page has fewer than
    `TEXT_LAYER_MIN_CHARS` characters — a scanned/image-only document. This is reported, not
    raised: the caller (P2-A) turns it into `statements.status = 'no_text_layer'`.

    If `[privacy] store_extract_cache` is enabled in settings, writes the joined page text to
