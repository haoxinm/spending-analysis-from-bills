"""Layout C parser — ``layout_c_credit`` (§2c "Layout C").

Layout C has **no section-heading lines**. Instead, the transaction table repeats its own
column-header row once per section, and the header row's second cell doubles as the section's
name:

- Header row 1: ``TRANS. DATE`` · ``PAYMENTS AND CREDITS`` · ``AMOUNT`` (3 columns)
- Header row 2: ``TRANS DATE`` · ``PURCHASES`` · ``MERCHANT CATEGORY`` · ``AMOUNT`` (4 columns)

Note the inconsistent punctuation between the two header spellings (``TRANS. DATE`` vs
``TRANS DATE``) — periods are stripped before matching so both are recognized.

Column bands are re-derived independently for each section, because the two sections have
different column counts (one global band map would misplace ``MERCHANT CATEGORY`` and
``AMOUNT`` in the payments-and-credits section, which has no category column at all). Each
section's bands come from its own header row's word x-positions directly, rather than from
`layout.infer_column_bands`'s recurring-gap heuristic: a fixed-width-rendered column always
*starts* at the same x-position on every row (header and data alike), because the printed cell
to its left is padded out to that column's full width — but a cell's own trailing whitespace is
invisible, so the *gap* an unrelated row happens to show before a following column varies with
how much of that column's width its own content fills. A merchant-description column is exactly
where that bites: a short header word (``PURCHASES``) sits inside a column sized for much longer
merchant names, so the recurring-gap heuristic (tuned for tables with roughly uniform cell
widths) locates the boundary using the header's own short content instead of the data's true
column width. Column *starts*, not gaps, are what stay put.

**Sign (I5):** payments and credits print with a leading ``-`` (negative = money returning to the
user); purchases print unsigned (positive = outflow). Values are mapped exactly as printed via
`layout.parse_money`, which already satisfies I5.

**Dates:** one column, no year. Year is inferred against the statement period the same way as
Layout B (`layout.infer_year`): a December date on a January statement lands in the prior year.
Reading the period is mandatory — without it a yearless date cannot be resolved, so a missing
summary block is a `ParserError`, never a guess from today's date.

**`MERCHANT CATEGORY` (A16):** captured verbatim and untrimmed into
`RawTransaction.issuer_category`. It is a local-only field (I1b) and is never folded into
`description` — a transaction's `description` only ever comes from the section-name column.
