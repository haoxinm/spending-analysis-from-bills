"""The ingest pipeline (§3.12a, P2-A): two-phase import (A22), reconciliation (A25), drift
detection (A18), dedupe (§3.5), account resolution (D4), and checking->credit transfer pairing
(I11, A26).

```
PHASE 1 (`propose_import`, automatic on upload)
  sha256 -> idempotency check
  -> extract text layer                          [ingest.extract, P1-A]
  -> no text layer?  status='no_text_layer', STOP
  -> locate table bands                          [ingest.layout.locate_table_bands, P0-7]
  -> match issuer against issuers.match_terms    [ingest.issuer_match, §2f.4]
  -> resolve remembered spec + score built-in parsers
  -> status='awaiting_extractor'; return an ImportProposal

PHASE 2 (`confirm_import`, on user confirmation, or automatically when the proposal is confident)
  -> parse -> RawTransaction[]                   [the resolved parser]
  -> normalize + redact                          [ingest.normalize, P1-C]
  -> resolve (or create) the account             [D4]
  -> reconciliation check                        [A25]
  -> drift evaluation against the account's previous statement   [A18]
  -> dedupe against existing rows                [ingest.dedupe, §3.5]
  -> persist statement + transactions in one atomic DB transaction
  -> clean import only: update issuers.default_spec_id / last_used_at   [A23]
  -> pair checking-side card payments with their card-side payment      [I11, A26]
  -> return an ImportResult
```

Kind resolution (the ambiguous `'payment_or_refund'` hint, and the hint-less generic-parser
fallback, including the checking->credit transfer pattern of I11/A26) is `classify.kinds.
resolve_kind` — the single source of truth for those patterns (P2-B). This module calls it once
per row, right before persistence, since `transactions.kind` is `NOT NULL` and every row needs a
concrete `Kind` before the `INSERT`.
