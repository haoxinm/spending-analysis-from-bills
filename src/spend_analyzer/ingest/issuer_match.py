"""Issuer detection by template matching (§2f.4, A24).

A plain substring search over ``issuers.match_terms`` — deliberately so: inspectable, debuggable,
fixable by editing one list. It is scoped to the **non-table region of page 1** (`match_issuer`
reuses `layout.locate_table_bands`, P0-7) because bank names appear constantly *inside*
transaction descriptions (``PAYMENT TO CHASE``, ``ZELLE FROM BOFA``); a whole-document search
would confidently misattribute the issuer of a statement that merely mentions another bank.

Matching normalizes both the page text and every candidate term to two forms — casefolded,
punctuation-stripped, whitespace-collapsed (*spaced*) and additionally space-removed (*compact*) —
so a user-entered ``jp morgan chase`` matches a printed ``JPMorgan Chase`` even though the two
disagree about where the space goes; only the compact form lines up in that case. The longest
matching term (by either form) wins; a tie between two different issuers' longest matches is
**not** resolved — an ambiguous statement gets no auto-selected issuer (§2f.4's ``jpmorgan chase``
vs. bare ``chase`` example, and the "two issuers at comparable length" case).

This module is local-only twice over: it never imports an HTTP client (I3) and it never sends an
issuer name or `match_terms` anywhere (I1b) — matching happens entirely on this machine.
