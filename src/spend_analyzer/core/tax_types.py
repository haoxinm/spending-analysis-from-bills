"""Domain types for income and tax analysis from tax forms (W-2, 1099 family, 1040).

Pure data and vocabulary: no I/O, no database, no network, and no LLM import. Tax data reaches an
egress seam only through the opt-in `TaxFallbackExtractor` (see below), never by default.

**Sign and unit convention (D6):** every amount is an integer count of minor currency units
(cents), USD only in v1. `ParsedIncomeItem.amount_minor` is the amount as received: positive is
income, and a net capital *loss* is negative (only `short_term_capital_gain` and
`long_term_capital_gain` may be negative). `ParsedTaxItem.amount_minor` is a non-negative
magnitude of tax withheld, owed or paid; for the "result" group (`refund`, `amount_owed`) the
category carries the direction and the amount stays non-negative. 1099-B proceeds and cost basis
are not stored, only the net gain or loss per holding term.

**Source versus return (D4):** W-2 and 1099 forms are "source" documents; a 1040 (or a state
return) is a "return" document. They describe the same income, so summing both double counts.
Aggregation takes income and withholding from source forms, and liability, refund, owed and the
preferential-versus-ordinary split from the return form. With no source forms for a year, income
falls back to the return's line items.

**Fallback (opt-in):** parsed items and forms carry their provenance (`origin`, `extraction_method`;
default ``"parser"``). Only the optional LLM fallback produces ``"llm"``; the user's manual edits
produce ``"manual"`` in the database layer.

**Privacy (D3):** a full SSN, ITIN or EIN never appears in these types; only the last four digits
(`payer_tin_last4`, `account_last4`). Recipient name and address are never captured. `payer_name`
is local only, like `issuers.name`.
