"""Core data types shared by every ingest and classification module (§3.1).

Frozen and slotted: these values are immutable once constructed, which matters because a
`ParsedStatement` is produced by a parser and then consumed, unmodified, by the ingest pipeline,
reconciliation, and tests.

**Sign convention (I5):** `RawTransaction.amount_minor` is a *signed* integer count of minor
currency units (cents for USD). Positive means money leaving the user (a purchase, a fee); negative
means money returning to the user (a refund, a credit). Every parser must assert this sign
explicitly in its tests.
