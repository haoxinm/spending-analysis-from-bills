"""Local-only issuer match preview for the issuer/onboarding screens (A24).

This module only ever calls `ingest.extract.extract`, `ingest.layout.locate_table_bands`, and
`ingest.issuer_match.non_table_page_one_text` (all already used elsewhere in this codebase, and
all local-only per their own docstrings) against PDFs already staged on disk, and returns only
statement metadata (id, status, original name, period) — never page text — to the API layer.
Never imports anything from `classify/llm/` (I1b/I3).
