"""Shared upload hardening for PDF endpoints (A12), used by `/api/statements` and `/api/tax`.

A 25 MB cap enforced while streaming (never buffers an oversized file whole), a content-type
check, a `%PDF-` magic-byte check, a `sha256`-derived stored filename (never the user-supplied
name), and a sanitized `original_name` before it is ever echoed back.

SECURITY-SENSITIVE: changes here affect every upload route. Moved verbatim from
`api/routers/statements.py`; behaviour must stay identical.
