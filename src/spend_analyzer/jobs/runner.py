"""One in-process worker thread consuming a queue of jobs, writing progress to the `jobs` table
(A1, D6). A single writer thread avoids SQLite write contention by construction; endpoints enqueue
a callable and return the `job_id` immediately.

Each queued task is a zero-argument callable that does its own DB work with its own `Session`
(from the shared `session_factory`) and reports progress through the `JobProgress` handed to it,
which updates the `jobs` row and commits after every update so progress survives a page reload
and two concurrent runs never corrupt each other's row (each has its own `job_id`/row).
