"""Batching, retries, and progress reporting for LLM classification (§3.7 "batching.py").

Splits a list of `description_clean` values into batches of `cfg.batch_size` (default 50; smaller
for local models with tight context), calls `egress.classify_batch` per batch, retries any row
that came back missing or invalid once in a smaller batch (size 10), and falls back rows that are
still missing to `others/uncategorized` with `needs_review=True` — **one bad row, or one failed
provider call, never fails a run** (matches the "no provider configured" first-class mode in
`egress.classify_batch`).

All batches issued for one user action share a `group_id` (uuid4, A2), so P2-B can persist one
`llm_runs` row per underlying call while reporting progress and cost per user action.
