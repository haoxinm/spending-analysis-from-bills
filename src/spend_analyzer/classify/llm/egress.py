"""Classification egress boundary (§3.7).

This module owns invariants **I1** (only `description_clean`, as CSV, ever leaves the machine
for classification), **I2** (it is one of only two modules allowed to call the LLM transport,
`spend_analyzer.llm.client`; the other is `spend_analyzer.llm.statement_parser`, which runs only
for a statement the user explicitly chose to parse with the LLM), and **I10** (every automated classification records
provider, model, prompt version, schema mode, cost, and confidence — via `BatchResult`).

Public surface (per §3.7): `build_csv`, `assert_safe`, `classify_batch`, `preview_payload`.
`propose_layout_spec` (A20) is Phase 5 only and is not present here.
