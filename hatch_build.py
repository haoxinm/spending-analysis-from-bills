"""Hatchling build hook (P4-D): builds the frontend into `src/spend_analyzer/web/` before a
*standard* (non-editable) wheel is built, so that a built wheel/sdist-installed package ships the
UI (§4 "Built into `src/spend_analyzer/web/` ... production is one process on one port").

Never touches anything under `frontend/**` beyond invoking its own, already-committed `npm`
scripts (`npm ci`, `npm run build`) as subprocesses — `frontend/vite.config.ts` already points
`build.outDir` at `../src/spend_analyzer/web` (P1-F), so this hook only decides *when* to run that
existing build, not *how*.

Skipped for an editable install (`version == "editable"`, i.e. `uv sync` / `pip install -e .`) so
day-to-day development never needs `node`/`npm` installed just to sync Python dependencies; the
API still serves fine without `web/` (`create_app` mounts it only if present, P2-C). Also skipped
if `SPEND_ANALYZER_SKIP_FRONTEND_BUILD` is set (e.g. a CI job that only needs the sdist, or a
machine intentionally building without Node), or if a prebuilt `web/index.html` already exists and
`SPEND_ANALYZER_SKIP_FRONTEND_BUILD` is unset but `npm`/`node` are unavailable (a clear warning is
printed either way, since a wheel built without a warning that silently ships no UI would be
confusing to debug).
