/**
 * D9's one Playwright happy path (§2, §5 Phase 3 Gate 3): import a generated fixture PDF,
 * confirm the extractor, see the review queue, and read a chart on the dashboard — against the
 * real backend, booted by `e2e/global-setup.ts` (temp `SPEND_ANALYZER_HOME`, LLM mode "none"),
 * serving whatever is built into `src/spend_analyzer/web/` (`npm run build` first — CI does).
 * `baseURL` is set per-test from `process.env.E2E_BASE_URL`, which global setup reads off the
 * server's own printed URL, so this file hard-codes no port.
 *
 * Chromium is preinstalled at `/opt/pw-browsers` (`PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` is set in this
 * environment); this project only ever runs `chromium`, so `npx playwright install` is never
 * needed here.
